# Project Description

This project simulates a negotiation process between a user and a chatbot for product pricing. The bot can accept, reject, or counteroffer based on the user's inputs. It is powered by Google's Generative AI model (Gemini), providing dynamic responses during the negotiation process. The main aim is to showcase the integration of machine learning models in creating interactive applications with complex business logic, like price negotiation.
